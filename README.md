Resources for drug response prediction resesarch

# Goal

To identify effective anti-cancer drug for patient by examinging each patient's gene using machine learning algorithm

# Challenges

## Volume of data

- Lack of clinical data

## Characteristics of data

- Low ratio of samples to features: not ideal for Deep neural network(DNN)

# Methods

## Data

- Genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer(GDSC)

- Patient-derived xenografts(PDX)

Machine learning

- kNN
- SVM
- Ridge logistic regression

Deep learning

- Neural network
